.SH "NAME"
ipa\-server\-certinstall \- Install new SSL server certificates
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
ipa\-server\-certinstall [\fIOPTION\fR]... FILE...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Replace the current Directory server SSL certificate, Apache server SSL certificate, Global Catalog certificate and/or Kerberos KDC certificate with the certificate in the specified files. The files are accepted in PEM and DER certificate, PKCS#7 certificate chain, PKCS#8 and raw private key and PKCS#12 formats.

PKCS#12 is a file format used to safely transport SSL certificates and public/private keypairs.

They may be generated and managed using the NSS pk12util command or the OpenSSL pkcs12 command.

The service(s) are not automatically restarted. In order to use the newly installed certificate(s) you will need to manually restart the Directory, Apache, Global Catalog and/or Krb5kdc servers.

If the ACME service is enabled then the web certificate must have a Subject Alternative Name (SAN) for ipa-ca.$DOMAIN.
